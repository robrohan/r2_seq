# R2_SEQ

R2_SEQ is a simple sequencer to control external midi devices. It runs in the browser and uses the [Web Midi API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_MIDI_API) to communicate with midi devices over USB.

Currently, is has only been tested in Chrome on a Macbook, but it [should work](https://caniuse.com/midi) on other browsers as well.

This was done in a weekend for an art project I am working on, and the code is hacked together by modifying the very cool browser based [pl_synth](https://github.com/phoboslab/pl_synth).
